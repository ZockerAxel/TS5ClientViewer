# About
This is an external Client Viewer which you can use as an Overlay for a Stream, Video or something else (for example in OBS). It's highly customizable to fit your needs.

# Customization
To customize, just visit [https://ts5viewer.endercentral.eu](https://ts5viewer.endercentral.eu). In your TeamSpeak 5 Client, you should receive a request by the Client Viewer in your Notifications. Accept it to see a preview of the settings you can adjust in the Customization Interface. If you changed your Remote App Port in your TeamSpeak 5 Client, use [https://ts5viewer.endercentral.eu?app_port=5899](https://ts5viewer.endercentral.eu?app_port=5899) and replace 5899 with your changed App Port.

When you're done, you can copy the Export-URL. This will be the URL you want to use in OBS as a Browser Source or wherever you want to use it.

# Closing Words
I created this Viewer as I needed an Overlay for my Stream. I originally used DerTyp7's Overlay but due to the shortcomings it had (had to write custom css to align it to the right, it often broke down, 2-level-deep sub-channels didn't work, needed to reload it a lot), I wanted to create my own. I wanted to make it as customizable as possible to cover a large amount of use-cases for such an Overlay.
